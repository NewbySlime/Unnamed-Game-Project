The connection between a child program and the main program will use "send" or "req"'
child process can't use iostream, because it need to use standard input for functionality

example:
~~magic number here~~~~some bytes here~~~~and 1 byte for the terminator~~

and after the "send" and "req" there's a function id, if a function is run asynchronously, the child process or parent will know what and where does a function called and 2 bytes for process id, since it runs on socket

the difference for each magic numbers is for differentiating each functions

The constant for magic numbers:
send = 0x0b534e44 | 190,008,900
req = 0x0b524551 | 189,941,073
operational = 0x0b6f7072 | 191,852,658
lineTerm = 0x0d


-----------------------
For startups, the IOSocket read 4 chars for knowing the id of a program and the port will be used


-----------------------
After a socket has been accepted, the program have to send some bytes to give some information

size: 2 bytes

pp

pp is a 2 bytes of Process ID


-----------------------
The calling can be used like normal functions and accessing variables

example:
ppppxxiiyyyy....

pppp is a 4 bytes of magic number

xx is a 2 bytes for indicating which function will be used

ii is a 2 bytes for indicating functionID


yyyy.... are the parameters, no matter how many bytes will it be passed, since it's restricted to specific length by the main program
it isn't seperated by specific byte, the difference between one parameter and the other is considered by how many bytes the param type has


-----------------------
After the calling, there's must be a "req" calling if the function returns one
it's just a "req" followed by bytes of the returned type

example:
ppppiiyyyy

yyyy is the returned variable

ii is a 2 bytes for indicating functionID


-----------------------
FuncID is used to for differentiating which function it called before (good counter-measure for multi threaded process child)

While FuncCode is used to determine which function the child wants to call


-----------------------
input to child program is used to let child know there's ...
